# PYeelight (Temporary name)

Control Xiaomi Mi Yeelight (RGB) with shell scripts. Should work under any recent Linux with a `bash` or `zsh` - sorry, don't know if that works under Windows/CygWin or Macos - you might need to rewrite the last line in the `yeelight.sh` script (e.g. by pipeing the output to `netcat`).

## Setup

You need to connect the light using the Yeelight app (or using any other appropriate way) to your network. Then enable `Developer Mode` (or `LAN Control Mode` in the current version of the app) for the light. This setting may need to be reset after a firmware update. You should also make sure that your DHCP server always assigns the same IP address to the light.

Now edit the `yeelight-ips` file and enter the IP address of each light you have, separated by a space.

## Running

Each of the `yeelight-*.sh` scripts has a specific function that is hopefully quite easy to guess from it's name. All the scripts call the `yeelight.sh` script that really does the job. Each script requires several parameters - calling them without any will give you a usage prompt. All scripts require the `ID` of a light - this is the position of the light you entered in the setup part. The first light has the `ID` 0.

## Examples

Switch on (to last used values)
```ShellSession
./yeelight-scene.sh 0 On
```

Switch on using 4300 Kelvin
```ShellSession
./yeelight-scene.sh 0 4300
```

Switch on Rainbow
```ShellSession
./yeelight-scene.sh 0 Rainbow
```

Switch on Disco
```ShellSession
./yeelight-scene.sh 0 Disco
```

Switch on Disco with 120ms
```ShellSession
DISCOSPEED=120 ./yeelight-scene.sh 0 Disco
```

Set brightness to 50%
```ShellSession
./yeelight-brightness.sh 0 50
```

Set RGB color to BLUE (using absolut number, decimal and hex triples)
```ShellSession
./yeelight-rgb.sh 0 255
./yeelight-rgb.sh 0 0,0,255
./yeelight-rgb.sh 0 x0,0,ff
```

Set hue (hsv) to 32 (yellow) with 80% brightness (of that color - 0 means full white)
```ShellSession
./yeelight-hue.sh 0 32 80
```

Set color temperature to 6500 Kelvin
```ShellSession
./yeelight-colortemp.sh 0 6500
```

## Integration with redshift

`yeelight-redshift.sh` is a script that allows your lamp to change color temperature simultaneously with your monitor if you use [redshift](http://jonls.dk/redshift/). Just like redshift, this script eases strain on your eyes if you use your computer at night. To use this script you need to copy `./samples/yeelight-redshift.timer` and `./samples/yeelight-redshift.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/`, change scrip location in `yeelight-redshift.service`. Then run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, `sudo systemctlt enable yeelight-redshift.timer`, `sudo systemctl start yeelight-redshift.timer`.

You can also change some values in `yeelight-redshift.sh` if you need warmer color. 

For the script to work you need to have redshift installed.

## HA-Bridge and Amazon Alexa

I am personally using this scripts on a Synology NAS with a running [HA-Bridge](https://github.com/bwssytems/ha-bridge/).
Since the scripts don't require any additional tool or access rights you can just execute them directly from the HA-Bridge.
Make sure the scripts are executable (`chmod +x *.sh`) and either you are using the full path or put them somewhere inside $PATH, for example `/usr/local/bin/`.

I have setup different scenes as devices for the same light. There is a `bedroom` device which can be switched on/off and use the dim feature - this is just a normal setup. And there is also a `sleep` and a `rainbow` device that addresses the same light to apply this scenes.

`yeelight-disco.sh` is a wrapper that only accepts one value - I use `${intensity.percent}` from HA-Bridge. There is some math done with that value to fit into the 2-99% range (Strange: I can't tell Alexa to use 1 or 100%) and still have some 'disco-speed'. Adjust to your needs.
